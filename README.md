## DEEP LEARNING BASED 3D VISUALIZATION OF BLOOD CELLS FROM MICROSCOPIC IMAGING
Blood cell analysis plays a crucial role in diagnosing various medical conditions, including infections, immune disorders, and blood-related diseases. White blood cells (WBCs) are a fundamental component of the immune system, and their classification into different types – Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Neutrophils, and Eosinophils—is essential for accurate medical diagnosis. Traditional methods of blood cell classification rely on manual microscopic examination by pathologists, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and prone to human error. To overcome these limitations, automated image classification using deep learning techniques has emerged as a powerful solution.

This project introduces a deep learning-based 3D visualization system for blood cells, designed to enhance both medical diagnostics and biological education. The core of the system utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to classify white blood cells based on microscopic images. The model effectively differentiates between Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Neutrophils, and Eosinophils by extracting unique morphological features from the images. To further extend its functionality, 3D models of these blood cells were developed using Blender, providing an interactive visualization that helps in understanding their structure in detail.
